description:
   This page is about how to install Jekyll with Rbenv on a VirtualBox Debian Guest.
   Why Rbenv?  Because This Is How Me Do It!
   If it works today, there is no warranty if it will still work the day after.

# PART 2: User Mode

### (user) Test X11 with xclock

* You should have installed "xclock" (x11-apps) on your Debian guest.
* You should enable option X11 when ssh to the virtual guest.
* Your NAT ports may be different. Assuming user "cbkadal" with local port is "6023".

```
ssh -X -p 6023 cbkadal@localhost

```
* Test it if you can display "xclock" on your host.

```
xclock

```
