**"[This Is](https://youtu.be/jEoM3qan9Gs)"** a collection of
**"[How Me Do It](https://youtu.be/jEoM3qan9Gs)"** records.
More precisely, how me <b>DID</b> it in the past.
When you read this, it might already have been done differently!
You might ask why "<b>ME,</b>" not "<b>I</b>"?
Because <b>ME</b> rhymes better.


Therefore, this is <b>NOT</b> about the <b>BEST PRACTICE</b> to do something!
No animals were harmed while creating these pages.
No original ideas were used on these pages.
Most ideas were shamelessly stolen from "Here, There, and Everywhere",
including but not limited to 
"bootstrap," 
"GitHub Page Themes,"
"Mike Dane,"
"stack overflow,"
"w3schools," 
et al.

This site was developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/) 
and is deployed on [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/).
Unfortunately, it is <b>NOT</b> "mobile-friendly" (yet).
If you like it, you can do whatever you want: clone it, fork it, copy it, or even ignore it!
